	<h2>Java-Unit 1</h2>
		<p><div>Description:</div>  
		<div>In Unit 1 of Java we were asked to create a story that had multiple endings where in the end the some of the outcomes would be good and some would be bad. The more sets of choices you had the more points the teacher will give you for this assignment. In my story the background theme was you were inside a house and you could call your parents, call your sister, run, or go find car keys. Then from each of those senerios you had more choices and it just kept going and going until you found your self safe or endagered. I really enjoyed making this story and really enjoyed playing it as well.</div>
</p>
<p><div>Concepts Learned:</div>
<div>Some of the concepts learned in this Unit of Java was how to make a game where you could type in a certain choice and it would bring you to two more choices and it would just go on and on until them the story was over and you either one and made it out safely or lost and go stuck inside the house. Another concept learned was how to make it account for errors such as spelling. Unfortunaly I wasn't abe to figure that part out but I'm sure a lot of others were able to.</div>
