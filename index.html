	<h2>My Interests, clubs, sports, and hobbies</h2>
		<p>
		<div>Some of my interests include playing baseball, going on vaccations as well as going to the becah and mountain biking with my friends! I started playing baseball when I was 4 years old and I've love to play the sport everyday. Everytime I go to shcool I look foward to playing baseball everyday after school. While at the beach I love to body board and surf. I used to surf a lot in Hawaii when we went there for vaccations and I'm so glad that I was able to get back into the sport. Also just this summer I got really serious into body boarding and I look foward to every weekend, so I can perform these sports. Currently at the moment I am not mountain biking because I just sold my bike and I am currently looking for a new bike.</div>
