<h1>Why I Like This Movie</h1>
<p>
I like this movies because it is very action packed and filled with mind blowing adventures to save the world. I have always like action packed movie since I was a kid becuase I think it just brings lots of suspense and actually brings the movie to life. I hope that they make an Iron Man 4 later in the fututre and that the movie brings more action packed adventures than the last one!

<h1>My favorite Actor is Robert Downey Jr.</h1>
<p>
My Favorite Actor is Robert Downey Jr. becuase he plays Iron Man in Iron Man 3 and all the rest of the marvel super hereo movies. He is well rounded man that plays Iron Man so incredibly well. When he plays the role of Iron Man, he just brings so much life into the character. I hope that Robert continues to make movies later in the future!
