	<h2>Name Project</h2>
		<p><div>Description:</div>  
		<div>Use scratch to design and create a program that shows my name . The requirements were to add a sprite for each letter of my name and give them 3 unique behaviors. The program needed to run when the green flag was clicked and for the extra credit I added a function to reset the scene to the beginning each time the green flag was clicked.The R in my name went right to left constantly. The Y in my name went up and down. The A in my name was spinning in a circle and the N was changing colors.</div>
</p>
<p><div>Concepts Learned:</div>
<div>Using event blocks- green flag clicked when key is pressed</div>
<div>Conditional statements- used if statements to make the letter move</div>
<div>Used loops- I used a forever block to have the statement be constantly going</div>
<div>Sprites- I created my own sprites using the sprite editor, I used the library of sprites to find letters in my name and adjusted the costumes</div>
<div>Movement- I used the x and y values to make my sprites move to their original location when the green flag was clicked, I rotated my sprites and made the color change on them</div>
</p>

<h2>Final Project</h2>
<p><div>Description:</div>
<div>Our final project is where we had to create a game using Scratch. Some requirements were that we had let the player know that they won, keep score, have a timer, have a help screen with direction on the game. Also the game must reset when the green flag is pressed and the game stops when its over. Lastly the one thing that should be included is as you play is each level get harder. In a my game bannas would constantly fall from the clouds and you had to use the brown bowl to collect them in your basket. There were 3 levels and you had to catch falling bananas for 10 sec per level. The higher level you go up the faster the bananas fall.</div>

</p>
<p><div>Concepts Learned:</div>
<div>Used event blocks- green clicked when key is pressed<div/>
<div>Conditional statements- used if statments to end the game or switch to the next level<div/>
<div>Used loops- I used forever loops to keep the game going and have the bananas falling or having the timer run down<div/>
<div>Sprites- Picked from an assorted gallery of sprites to create my game<div/>
<div>Movement- the bananas were also falling and you could move the bowl left and right using the right and left arrow keys</div>
