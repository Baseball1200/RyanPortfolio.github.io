	<h2>Python Unit 1-Lab Runner</h2>
	<p><div>Description:</div></p>
	<p>In Unit 1 we learned multiple things on how to make a game. We learned the basics of how to start the game and what the keys were to play the game. In Lab Runner in Unit 1 we had to make a blank white screen and then dsplay a character and the character had to be able to move around using the arrow keys or the WASD keys.</div></p>
	<p><div>Concepts Learned:</div></p>
	<p><div>Some of the concepts we learned was how to display a character on the wall and make the character able to move around the screen in all different directions. Another thing that we started to learn is collision and make it so when the character hits the side of the walls it stops instead of moving past off the screen.</div></p>
	
	<h2>Python Unit 2-Wall Runner</h2>
	<p><div>Description:</div></p>
	<p><div>In this lab called Wall Runner we had to add to our game from the last Unit Lab Runner. The first thing we added was a big square wall right in the middle of our screen. The first thing we did with our person is make him have collosions on him so that way he cant go behind or through the wall, Again like the last Unit we made the guy move around as well.</div></p>
	<p><div>Concepts Learned:</div></p>
	<p><div>Some of the Concepts that we learned in Unit 2 were collosions so that the Character can move all around the screen when he wants but when hes gets closed to the wall our touches the wall he stops so that way he cant move through the wall or behind the wall. He just simply has to go around the wall.</div></p>
	
	<h2>Python Unit 3-Ground Runner</h2>
	<p><div>Description:</div></p>
	<p><div>In Ground Runner in Unit 3 our task was to create not only one character but two character, controling one with WASD and another using the arrow keys.In my case I made one character a baseball and the other a coin. The baseball was controlled using the arrow keys and the coin was controlled using the WASD keys. Also wehad to make a background and add rocks to it.</div></p>
	<p><div>Concepts Learned:</div></p>
	<p><div>Some of the concepts learned in Unit 3 Ground Runner is we learned how to create multiple characters and have them be moved by the arrow keys and the WASD keys. Also we learned about collosions again which mad it when u hit the rocks it was game over so you had to move around them.</div></p>
	
	<h2>Python Unit 4-Dodge Runner</h2>
	<p><div>Description:</div></p>
	<p><div>In Unit 4, Dodge Runer we had to create a guy that would start at the top of the game and snakes would flow across the screen of the game and the goal of the game was to get back and forth without hitting one of the snakes. If you were able to complete that task you won.</div></p>
	<p><div>Concepts Learned:</div></p>
	<p><div>Some of the concepts learned was collide and also we had to make the snakes be constanly moving across the screen. Also a score counter was added to the screen along with a timer and everytime you made it across you got a point.</div></p>
	
	<h2>Python Final Project</h2>
	<p><div>Description:</div></p>
	<p><div>In my Final Project I wanted to create a game that was about baseball. So I made a character that was a baseball and then i was able to move it around. I also made a golve that would appear in random spots so you would have to move the ball around trying to get it in the glove and everytime you did that you got a point. I also made a bat appear that if you hit it, the game would be over.</div></p>
	<p><div>Concepts Learned:</div></p>
	<p><div>Some of the concepts learned was collide when you collide with the bat its game over and when you collide with the glove you get a point and the glove re appears to a different location. 20 seconds were put on the clock to collect as many points as possible!</div></p>
