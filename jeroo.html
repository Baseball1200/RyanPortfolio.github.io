	<h2>Jeroo</h2>
		<h4>Unit 1</h4>
		<h5>Diamond Lab</h5>
		<p><div>Description:</div>
		<div>Jeroo is a coding based program that teaches students to move around different blocks, nets, or flowers. In Unit 1 we just started learning about the basics of Jeroo, for example how to turn, hop, and pick up flowers as well as toss flowers. In the labs we were asked to direct the Jeroo all the way around the green map to make a diamond shape. We could not let the Jeroo touch the water. In the other lab we had to direct the Jeroo all the way down without touching the nets. 
		<div>Concepts Learned:</div>
		<div>We learned in the Jeroo coding program how to turn right, turn left, hop from square to square and toss something as well as pick up flowers. We used all of these codes to create a diamond where we had to turn right left and hop as well as dropping flowers down.
		</p>
		<h4>Unit 2</h4>
		<h5>Escape Lab</h5>
		<p><div>Description:</div>
		<div>In Unit 2 we leanred about methods, which is where you can basiclly make a coding statement in the Jeroo methods and then in the main method you have your Jeroo repeat the statemet for as long as you want. This makes coding a lot easier becuase now you don't have to write out all of the code which can take for ever.
		<div>Concepts Learned</div>
		<div>We learned how to make methods in this Unit and then to copy the method over into our main method. For example in this lab we had to make the Jeroos follow through the maze and get to the flower and then pick the flower up. This was tricky becuase there were four Jeroos and it would take forever to write the code. Instead we used methods and just wrote the method four times for each Jeroo.
	    </p>
		<h4>Unit 3</h4>
		<h5>Flowers 2 Lab</h5>
		<p><div>Description:</div>
		<div>In Unit 3 we learned to used if statements. For example we could make an if statments that says if water AHEAD turn right. This basically meant that the Jeroo will hop foward a space every time until it reaches water. Once it reaches water the Jeroo will turn right and then the Jeroo will keep going on its way.
		<div>Concepts Leanred:</div>
		<div>Some of the concepts that we learned in this Unit was to turn right, hop, turn left, as well as if statements. For example if water AHEAD turn right. That statement is what I used in this lab to complete it without writing so much code which would take so long and be very hard.
		</p>
		<h4>Unit 4</h4>
		<h5>Spiral Maze Lab</h5>
		<p><div>Description:</div>
		<div>In Unit 4 we were introduced to While methods and we also got more comfortable in using if statements. In the spiral maze lab we had to direct the Jeroo around the maze and make sure it doesnt touch the water. If the Jeroo touches the water then the Jeroo goes back to the beginnning and he has to restart.
		<div>Concepts Learned:</div>
		<div>The concepts we learned in this Unit were while loops, if statments,turn right,turn left, hop, pick, and toss. We had to use all those different commands to make the Jeroo follow the maze all the way to end without it touching the water. If it were to touch the water the Jeroo would have to restart and try again until he made it all the way to the finish.
