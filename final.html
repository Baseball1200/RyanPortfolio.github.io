		<h2>Final Project</h2>
		<p><div>Description:</div>  
		<div>In the last Unit of the Computer Science Class we were asked to create a final game using all of the techniques we had learned over the course of the class. In my final game I decided to add to one of my other games in scratch. The way that you would play my game is there would be a bowl that you could control using the right and left arrow keys and bananas and apples would constanly fall, and you would only want to try and catch the bananas not the apples. If the apples hit the bowl the game would be over and same goes for the banana if it hit the  ground the game would also be over. There were three levels each lasting 5 seconds each. </div>
</p>
<p><div>Concepts Learned:</div>
<div>Some of the concepts learned throughout creating this project is how to implement list, use all the variables such as sprites and locals, use conditional statements like else if, forever and repeating loops, have 5 levels, and four block methods, along with user interaction and to make sure there is no bugs in the game and works perfectly fine every time it is played.</div>
